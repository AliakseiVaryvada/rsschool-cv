## About myself
I am a Salesforce developer with background experience in PCB layout and schematic design, repair of computer equipment of various difficulty levels and most recently software development. After four years working in hardware direction, I want to improve my coding and reorient my career. I can create independent interface elements and using ready-made libraries, I understand what semantic markup is, I work both with flexbox and grid layout, and know what adaptability is. 
For a long time I have been developing devices and assembling prototypes. I have experience in working with Arduino / esp32 and developing not very difficult software for them. Iâ€™m a member of a startup, where my field is the development of the device and the assembly of the prototype brain-computer interface. At free time I practice solving tasks on the CodeWars.
I have work experience working with Salesforce and Freshworks platforms as server and front side software developer.
I am free from military service. I am interested in wrestling (Aikido, BJJ) and swimming: it helps to clear after a day spent working on the computer.
